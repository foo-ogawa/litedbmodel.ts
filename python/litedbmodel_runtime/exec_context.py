"""litedbmodel v2 SCP — the **ExecutionContext + central execute/run seam** (Phase A / #78, python).

The Python port of the TS contract-defining artifact ``src/scp/exec-context.ts`` (#75), mirroring the
rust port ``rust/litedbmodel_runtime/src/exec_context.rs`` (#76) and the go port
``go/litedbmodel_runtime/exec_context.go`` (#77). It replaces the raw ``driver: Driver`` threaded
through ``execute_bundle`` / ``execute_read_graph`` / the relation walker / ``execute_transaction_bundle``
with an :class:`ExecutionContext` that carries:

  1. a **connection provider** — :meth:`ExecutionContext.connection_for` ``(intent)`` resolves WHICH
     connection a statement runs on (the tx-owned connection, else the primary driver; Phase A wires
     only the tx-owned + single-DB cases, reader/writer/named-DB are B/C/D on this seam);
  2. a **middleware chain** — :attr:`ExecutionContext.middleware`, wrapping every SQL (empty in
     Phase A = passthrough; the registration API is Phase D — this is only the hook point);
  3. a **pinned tx connection** — a tx-scoped ctx pins ONE owned connection so every statement in a
     transaction body runs on it (per-execution connection ownership, §3).

## The central seam (§2) — ALL SQL funnels through here

::

    execute(ctx, sql, params) -> Rows      # SELECT / RETURNING reads
    run(ctx, sql, params)     -> RunInfo   # INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK

Both do the SAME three things, in order:
  ① run the middleware chain (empty ⇒ passthrough, behavior unchanged);
  ② resolve the connection via ``ctx.connection_for(intent)``;
  ③ execute on that connection (the ONLY driver contact point).

Every direct ``driver.prepare(sql).all()/run()`` in the read / tx / relation path is replaced by a
call through this seam. A ``grep`` for ``.prepare(`` outside the connection adapters (this module's
:class:`DriverConnection` and the driver ``begin_tx`` handles) comes up empty in the runtime SQL
path — that is the AC.

## ONE interface, not sync/async-bifurcated (contract flag)

The TS reference bifurcates into ``ExecutionContext``/``execute`` (better-sqlite3, sync) and
``AsyncExecutionContext``/``executeAsync`` (pg/mysql2, async) because that split is TS-runtime
specific. Per the #78 contract flags the Python port **collapses to ONE interface**: Python's DB-API
is synchronous (stdlib ``sqlite3`` / psycopg / PyMySQL all block), so there is exactly ONE
:class:`ExecutionContext` / one :func:`execute` / one :func:`run`. There is likewise **no
``executeSafeIntegers``** — that is a better-sqlite3 #59 BIGINT toggle; bc-Python evaluates integers
to a plain unbounded ``int`` and PG/MySQL return BIGINT as ``int``/``str`` natively, so the read seam
is a plain execute.

## Per-execution connection ownership (§3) — the concurrent-tx fix

A transaction acquires ONE connection via :meth:`Driver.begin_tx` (a :class:`TxConnection` owned
handle — the Python analogue of v1 ``PoolTransaction`` / go's ``*sql.Tx``), pins it into a tx-scoped
:class:`ExecutionContext` **propagated via** :data:`contextvars.ContextVar` (§3), runs its body (every
statement resolves that connection via ``connection_for``), COMMITs/ROLLBACKs on the SAME owned
connection, and releases it (back to the pool, or destroyed if poisoned). Concurrent transactions —
on distinct threads, each with its OWN ``contextvars`` copy — acquire DISTINCT pooled connections ⇒
isolated. There is NO driver-global single-slot writer (the removed ``_PooledDriver._writer`` slot on
the PG/MySQL drivers was exactly the shared-slot model that corrupts concurrent transactions).

         itself raised (rare but real: a deferred-constraint violation or a dropped connection at
         COMMIT). Without this ``finally`` a raising COMMIT would leak the connection (the pool would
         shrink by one under repeated commit failures — the #78 audit defect).

    ``before`` / ``after`` carry the per-transaction isolation prelude (Phase B / #84 —
    :func:`litedbmodel_runtime.tx_options.isolation_prelude`): MySQL's ``SET`` runs pre-BEGIN, PG's
    post-BEGIN. Empty ⇒ a bare ``BEGIN`` (byte-identical to the Phase A path).

    Concurrent calls (on distinct threads) each acquire a DISTINCT connection and pin it in their OWN
    contextvar scope, so their writes never cross-talk — the isolation the shared-slot model (the
    removed driver-global ``_writer``) violated. This mirrors the TS ``withTransactionAsync`` (#75) /
    rust ``with_transaction_decided`` (#76) / go ``WithTransactionDecided`` (#77).

    """**The public user-controlled transaction boundary** (#86, python port of the TS ``transaction``
    / rust ``transaction`` / go ``Transaction``) — the REAL transaction feature v2 was missing.
    ``transaction(ctx, fn, options?)`` opens ONE boundary the caller wraps around MULTIPLE arbitrary
    operations so they commit or roll back TOGETHER::

        transaction(ctx, lambda: [
            create_a(...),   # ← every op inside JOINS this ONE boundary:
            update_b(...),   #    one connection, one BEGIN…COMMIT, all-or-nothing.
        ], TransactionOptions(isolation=IsolationLevel.SERIALIZABLE))

    ## What it does (v1 ``DBModel.transaction`` :2787 parity, on the SCP seam)

    It acquires ONE owned connection (``driver.begin_tx`` with the isolation prelude), pins it into a
    tx-scoped :class:`ExecutionContext` **propagated via** :data:`contextvars` (:func:`run_with_pinned_context`),
    runs ``fn``, then COMMITs (or ROLLBACKs on a body error / ``options.rollback_only``), with the #81
    retry loop (deadlock / serialization / connection error) wrapped around the WHOLE boundary — a
    FRESH owned connection per attempt.

    ## The ambient-tx JOIN — how operations participate (the core #86 fix; python = contextvars)

    ``fn`` takes NO connection argument. Instead the pinned tx ctx lives in the ambient contextvar
    (:func:`current_context`). Every operation ``fn`` issues — a live-DB write via
    ``execute_transaction_bundle``, a read via ``execute_bundle`` — detects that ambient pinned ctx and
    runs its statements on THAT connection **without opening its own BEGIN/COMMIT** (the nested-join,
    below). So N operations inside one ``transaction(fn)`` produce exactly ONE BEGIN + ONE COMMIT on
    ONE connection. Outside a ``transaction(fn)`` the ambient pin is absent, so a bare guarded write's
    guard fires (:class:`WriteOutsideTransactionError`).

    NESTED ``transaction()`` joins the outer (one physical BEGIN/COMMIT; an inner error rolls back the
    WHOLE tx). Isolation/retry/rollback_only options on a nested call are IGNORED (the outer owns
    them). Mirrors v1 ``DBModel.transaction`` :2794-2797.
